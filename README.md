# What you need
1. First, make sure you have a Discord account. If you don't have one, you can create it by visiting the Discord website and following the sign-up process.

2. Once you have your Discord account, set up the server where you want to receive the information. You can either create a new server or use an existing one. If you choose to create a new server, follow the instructions on Discord to set it up. If you prefer to use an existing server, make sure you have the necessary permissions to create and manage webhooks.

3. In your Discord server, click on "Integrations" in the server settings menu. Then, click on "Webhooks" and choose "New Webhook" to create a new webhook.

4. Now you can customize your webhook by giving it a name and adding a profile picture if you want. After that, you need to assign the webhook to the desired channel where you want to receive the information. This can be a public channel that anyone can access or a private channel that only specific members can view.

5. Once you have created the webhook and assigned it to the channel, you will be provided with a unique webhook URL. Copy this URL.

6. Open the script.js file of your website. Look for the appropriate place to add the webhook URL. Paste the copied webhook URL in the designated location in the script.js file.

7. Finally, save the changes in the script.js file. To activate the webhook and start receiving the specified information, you need to refresh the page or click the link to your website.

Now you are done! All you need to do is refresh the page or click the link to your website and all of the specified information will be sent to the server on the channel you assign on step 4.
